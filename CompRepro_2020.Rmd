```{r setup, include=TRUE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## R Markdown file

This file, an R Markdown lets you combine plain text, in the white spaces, and code chunks, in the gray. The text is not really code, but can be used to communicate, while the code chunks let you combine the actual analysis you are running alongside the results. This means someone can see exactly what you did to get your results.

To add a chunk either click on the green Insert button and choose R or hit Command + Option + i (Mac) or Ctrl + Alt + i (PC)

```{r}
3+3
```

## Homework

1) Create an R Project to pull this file from GitHub. 

2) Please describe one of the ways that Wilson et. al. suggest is a good practice for computational reproducibility and how a tool like R can be used. Write your answer below.

- project organization= with the combo of github and R you can organize and share data easily among collaborators or within the lab.
- Keeping track of changes= with R you can see all the changes that a perosn did with their code. This helps in understanding and reproducing data. 

3) Add a code chunk and find the square root of 4 to the 13th power. If you are unsure of what command to use, google it. 

```{r}
sqrt(4^13)
```

4) Push this homework to the GitHub repository for the homework.
